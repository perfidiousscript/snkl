        <p>SNKL (pronounced Cenacle) is an interactive, user modifiable visualization of authors of the 20th century.</p>

        <p>Existing book suggestion algorithms are opaque and sometimes dead wrong</p>

        <p>SNKL seeks to make the connections between authors apparent, and the process of finding new works more efficient.</p>

        <p>This allows the reader to start from writers that they have previously enjoyed, select the type of connection that interests them, and search from there</p>
        <p>Each writer is displayed on a graph of time and relative style.</p>
        <p>The lines display the span of their like, the box spans the time between their first and last major works.</p>
        <p>Clicking on a author's box displays color coded lines to connected authors.</p>
        <p>Clicking on a writer will display more information about them.</p>
