        <p>SNKL (pronounced cenacle) is an interactive, user modifiable visualization of authors of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>Existing book suggestion algorithms are often opaque and sometimes dead wrong</p>
        <p>The purpose of SNKL is to provide an avenue for choosing new literature by demonstrating the various connections between writers.</p>
        <p>This allows the reader to start from writers that they have previously enjoyed, select the type of connection that interests them, and search from there</p>
        <p>Each writer is displayed on a graph of time and relative style.</p>
        <p>By clicking on a writer once color coded connections to other writers with be displayed.</p>
        <p>Double clicking on a writer will display more information about a writer.</p>
        <p>SNKL was written in AngularJS and d3.js by Sam Moss.</p>
